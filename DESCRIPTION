## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates the use of the `SimplexRegressionAMM` package to model impunity data across countries. 
We explore the advantages of parametric mean link functions (`plogit1`) compared to traditional fixed mean link functions, 
and provide comprehensive model diagnostics.

The impunity dataset contains information about various socioeconomic and political indicators for 119 countries, with the response variable measuring levels of impunity (a bounded variable in the open interval (0,1)).

## Loading the Data

```{r setup}
library(SimplexRegressionAMM)
data("impunity_dataset")
data_imp <- impunity_dataset
n <- nrow(data_imp)
```

### Data Overview

The dataset includes 119 observations and nine explanatory variables reflecting economic, institutional, and social aspects of each country:

- Economic Freedom Index (2022);
- Gini Index (2015);
- Health Expenditure as % of GDP (2020);
- Human Development Index (2019);
- GDP per capita (2018);
- Press Freedom Index (2023);
- Quality of Democracy Index (2020);
- Dummy variable for Nordic countries.

```{r data-structure}
str(data_imp)
```

A preview of the first few observations:

```{r data-head}
head(data_imp)
```

### Descriptive Statistics for the Response Variable

The response variable `Impunity` is bounded in the open interval (0,1) and consists of Impunity Index scores for 119 countries in 2023, as described in Santos and Cribari-Neto (2024).  

The Impunity Index is defined as one minus the Rule of Law Index published by the World Justice Project (WJP). Higher values correspond to weaker rule of law and higher levels of impunity.  

According to the WJP, the Rule of Law Index is built upon eight dimensions: constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, protection of fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice.

Let's examine the distribution of the response variable:

```{r descriptive-stats}
# Summary statistics
summary(data_imp$Impunity)

# Additional descriptive measures
cat("\nDescriptive Statistics for Impunity:\n")
cat("Std Dev:  ", round(sd(data_imp$Impunity), 4), "\n")
cat("Skewness: ", round(moments::skewness(data_imp$Impunity), 4), "\n")
cat("Kurtosis: ", round(moments::kurtosis(data_imp$Impunity), 4), "\n")
```

## Simplex Models with Parametric Mean Link Functions

One of the main features of simplex regression with a parametric mean link function is its ability to employ link functions that adapt to the structure of the data. These functions incorporate an additional parameter, \(\lambda\), which is estimated from the data, providing greater flexibility compared to fixed mean link functions.

We estimated simplex regression models with parametric mean link functions `plogit1` and `plogit2`, incorporating all eight covariates, selected powers of regressors, and interaction terms.

Predictor selection was guided by half-normal residual plots with simulated envelopes, pseudo-\(R^2\) Nagelkerke, and information criteria (AIC, SIC, HQIC).

### Model 1: plogit1 Parametric Mean Link Function

The first model uses the `plogit1` parametric mean link function and includes interactions between predictors:
  
```{r model-plogit1}
simplex_par1 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy,
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "plogit1", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex_par1)
```

#### Half-Normal Plot with simulated envelopes for Model 1

We use weighted residual (Espinheira and Silva, 2020) for the half-normal plot with simulated envelopes.

```{r diagnostic-par1, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 1. Half-normal plot with simulated envelope for Model 1."}
hnp.simplexreg(simplex_par1, type = "weighted", seed = 2008)
```

### Model 2: plogit2 Parametric Mean Link Function

The second model uses the `plogit2` parametric mean link function with a different dispersion structure:
  
```{r model-plogit2}
simplex_par2 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    I(Democracy*Press) + I(HealthSpending^1.6),
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "plogit2", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex_par2)
```

#### Half-Normal Plot with simulated envelopes for Model 2

```{r diagnostic-par2, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 2. Half-normal plot with simulated envelope for Model 2."}
hnp.simplexreg(simplex_par2, type = "weighted", seed = 2008)
```

### Model Selection: Parametric Mean Link Functions

We use the penalized Scout Score (SS) criterion with `kappa = 0.1` to select between models with parametric mean link functions:
  
```{r scout-score}
ss.simplexreg(simplex_par1, simplex_par2, kappa = 0.1)
```

We can also examine penalized information criteria with `kappa = 0.1`:
  
```{r penalized-ic}
penalized_ic(simplex_par1, kappa = 0.1)
penalized_ic(simplex_par2, kappa = 0.1)
```

## Models with Fixed Mean Link Functions

For comparison, we also fit simplex regression models using traditional fixed mean link functions (logit, probit, log-log, complementary log-log, and cauchit).  

These models help assess whether the flexibility provided by parametric mean link functions leads to better fit.

### Model with log-log Mean Link Function

```{r model-loglog}
simplex1 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy, 
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "loglog", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex1)
```

### Model with logit Mean Link Function

```{r model-logit}
simplex2 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy, 
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "logit", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex2)
```

### Model with probit Mean Link Function

```{r model-probit}
simplex3 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy,  
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "probit", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex3)
```

### Model with complementary log-log Mean Link Function

```{r model-cloglog}
simplex4 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    HealthSpending + I(Democracy^0.4), 
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "cloglog", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex4)
```

### Model with cauchit Mean Link Function

```{r model-cauchit}
simplex5 <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic |
    HealthSpending + I(Democracy^0.4), 
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "cauchit", link.sigma2 = "log")
summary(simplex5)
```

### Model Selection

We now compare the model with parametric mean link function (`plogit1`) to models using fixed mean link functions. For this comparison, we use the original Scout Score (`kappa = 0`).
  
```{r model-selection-all}
ss.simplexreg(simplex_par1, simplex1, simplex2, simplex3, simplex4, simplex5, kappa = 0)
```

Direct comparison between the best parametric mean link function model and best fixed mean link model:
  
```{r model-selection-best}
ss.simplexreg(simplex_par1, simplex1, kappa = 0)
```

The results indicate that `simplex_par1` (simplex model with plogit1 parametric mean link function) provides the best fit.

### Rao Score Test: Testing \(\lambda = 1\)

We can test whether the estimated lambda parameter is significantly different from 1. If \(\lambda = 1\), the plogit1 parametric mean link function reduces to the logit fixed mean link function.

```{r test-lambda}
scoretest.simplexreg(simplex2, link = "plogit1")
```

The null hypothesis \(H_0: \lambda = 1\) (which corresponds to the logit mean link) was rejected at the 1% significance level (p = 0.0011), confirming the relevance of using a parametric mean link function specification. 

## Model Diagnostics

We now perform comprehensive diagnostics on the selected model (`simplex_par1`). We use quantile residuals, which should approximately follow a standard normal distribution under correct model specification.

### Normality Test for Quantile Residuals

The quantile residuals from both models show no evidence of misspecification, as indicated by the Jarque-Bera normality test:

```{r normality-test}
tseries::jarque.bera.test(residuals(simplex_par1, type = "quantile"))
```

### Residual Plots

```{r residual-plots, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Figure 3. Residuals plots for Model 1."}
par(mfrow = c(3, 2), mar = c(3.7, 3.7, 1, 1), oma = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), mgp = c(2.5, 0.8, 0))
plot(simplex_par1, which = 1:6, type = "quantile")
```

### Cook's distances

The Cook’s distance plot indicates only one mildly influential observation (28: Denmark) with a value slightly above one.

```{r cooks distances, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 4. Cook's distances plot for Model 1."}
plot(simplex_par1, which = 7, type = "quantile")
```

### Local Influence Analysis

Local influence analysis helps identify observations that have disproportionate impact on parameter estimates. We consider two perturbation schemes: Case-Weight Perturbation Scheme and Response Perturbation Scheme.

```{r influence-case-weight, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 5. Local influence (Case-weight and Response perturbation) for Model 1."}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(3.7, 3.7, 1, 1), oma = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), mgp = c(2.5, 0.8, 0))

influences_cw <- local.influence_simplexreg(simplex_par1, scheme = "case.weight")$Ci.beta
names(influences_cw) <- 1:n

plot(influences_cw, xlab = "Observation index", ylab = expression(C[i*";"*beta]), pch = 16, cex = 0.8)
abline(h = 2*mean(influences_cw), lty = 2, col = "red")
# Identify influential observations
influential_cw <- which(influences_cw > 2*mean(influences_cw))
if(length(influential_cw) > 0) text(influential_cw, influences_cw[influential_cw], 
                                    labels = influential_cw, pos = 2, cex = 0.7, col = "blue")

influences_resp <- local.influence_simplexreg(simplex_par1, scheme = "response")$Ci.beta
names(influences_resp) <- 1:n

plot(influences_resp, xlab = "Observation index", ylab = expression(C[i*";"*beta]), pch = 16, cex = 0.8)
abline(h = 2*mean(influences_resp), lty = 2, col = "red")
# Identify influential observations
influential_resp <- which(influences_resp > 2*mean(influences_resp))
if(length(influential_resp) > 0) text(influential_resp, influences_resp[influential_resp], 
                                      labels = influential_resp, pos = 4, cex = 0.7, col = "blue")

cat("\nMean of values (case-weight):", mean(influences_cw), "\n")
cat("\nNumber of influential observations (case-weight):", 
    sum(influences_cw > 2*mean(influences_cw)), "\n")

cat("\nMean of values (response):", mean(influences_resp), "\n")
cat("\nNumber of influential observations (response):", 
    sum(influences_resp > 2*mean(influences_resp)), "\n")
```

## Visualizing Mean Link Functions

### Comparing Mean Link Functions 

This plot shows how the link functions employed in the simplex and beta models map linear predictors to the mean response:
  
```{r link-comparison, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 6. Plogit1 and probit link functions used in the simplex and beta regression models."}
eta <- seq(from = -2, to = 5.5, length.out = 250)
mu_plogit1 <- parametric_mean_link_inv(eta, simplex_par1$coefficients$lambda, "plogit1")
mu_probit <- fixed_mean_link_inv(eta, "probit")

matplot(eta, cbind(mu_plogit1, mu_probit), type = "l", lwd = 2, lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "blue"), 
        ylab = expression(mu[i]), xlab = expression(eta[1*i]))
legend("bottomright", 
       legend = c(bquote("plogit1 (" * lambda == .(round(simplex_par1$coefficients$lambda, 4)) * ")"), 
                  "probit"), lty = c(1, 2), cex = 0.7, col = c("black", "blue"),lwd = 2, bty = "n")
```

## Model `simplex_par1` with dummy for Luxemburg

Luxembourg appears as an influential case in the beta regression, which might reflect distinctive characteristics of that country. To investigate this, we added a dummy variable taking the value one for Luxembourg and zero for all other countries to the `simplex_par1` model. Interestingly, this variable is not statistically significant in the model (p-value: 0.8477).

```{r model dummy Luxemburg}
dummy <- rep(0, n); dummy[63] <- 1

simplex_par1_dummy <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) + dnordic + dummy 
  | EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy,
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "plogit1", link.sigma2 = "log"
)
summary(simplex_par1_dummy)
```

## Countries with the largest and smallest raw residuals

List of five countries with the largest and smallest raw residuals (\(r_i^b = Y_i - \hat{\mu}_i\)). Countries with \(r_i^b < 0\) are classified as overperforming---exhibiting lower impunity than expected---whereas countries with \(r_i^b > 0\) are underperforming, with impunity levels exceeding those predicted by the model.

```{r raw residuals}
raw_residuals <- data_imp$Impunity - simplex_par1$fitted.values
names1 <- data_imp[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5])), "Country"]
y1 <- data_imp$Impunity[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]))]
pred1 <- round(simplex_par1$fitted.values[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals, 
                                                                decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]))], 4)
res1 <- round(sort(raw_residuals, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5], 4)
cat("\n### Countries with the highest raw residuals:\n\n")
print(cbind(Country = names1, Obs = y1, Pred = pred1, Res = res1), quote = FALSE)

names2 <- data_imp[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals)[1:5])), "Country"]
y2 <- data_imp$Impunity[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals)[1:5]))]
pred2 <- round(simplex_par1$fitted.values[as.numeric(names(sort(raw_residuals)[1:5]))], 4)
res2 <- round(sort(raw_residuals)[1:5], 4)
cat("\n### Countries with the lowest raw residuals:\n\n")
print(cbind(Country = names2, Obs = y2, Pred = pred2, Res = res2), quote = FALSE)
```

## Nordic premium

In Santos and Cribari-Neto (2023), the inclusion of a dummy variable for the Nordic countries in the beta regression model resulted in an estimated average reduction of approximately 19% in their predicted levels of impunity. In the simplex regression model with a plogit1 link function, the estimated reduction in average predicted impunity remains directionally consistent but is considerably smaller---around 9%. 

```{r model-plogit1-no-dnordic}
simplex_par1_no_dnordic <- simplexreg(
  Impunity ~ EconomicFreedom + I(GDP^1.15) + I(HDI*HealthSpending) + I(Democracy*Press) |
    EconomicFreedom + HealthSpending + Democracy,
  data = data_imp, link.mu = "plogit1", link.sigma2 = "log")

sum1 = sum(simplex_par1_no_dnordic$fitted.values[data_imp$dnordic==1])
sum2 = sum(simplex_par1$fitted.values[data_imp$dnordic==1])

cat("\nEstimated average reduction in the predicted levels of impunity of Nordic countries:", 
    round((sum2 - sum1) / sum1 * 100, 2), "\n")

```

## Estimated simplex densities for models plogit1 and loglog

The estimated simplex densities for Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Germany, show that the observed values align more closely with the central region of the predictive densities under the parametric link model.

```{r estimated-simplex-densities, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.cap="Figure 7. Estimated simplex densities for Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Germany, under the fitted simplex regression models with plogit1 and log-log links."}
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), mar = c(3.7, 3.7, 2, 2), oma = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), mgp = c(2.5, 0.8, 0))

mu_par <- simplex_par1$mu.fv
mu_ll <- simplex1$mu.fv
sigma2_par <- simplex_par1$sigma2.fv
sigma2_ll <- simplex1$sigma2.fv

plot_density <- function(i, zmin, zmax, titulo = "") {
  z.range <- seq(from = zmin, to = zmax, length = 200)
  d_par1 <- dsimplex(z.range, mu_par[i], sigma2_par[i])
  d_ll   <- dsimplex(z.range, mu_ll[i],  sigma2_ll[i])
  
  matplot(z.range, cbind(d_par1, d_ll), type = "l",
    lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "gray60"),
    lwd = 2, xlab = "y", ylab = "f(y)",
    cex = 1.2, cex.lab = 1.6, cex.axis = 1.2)
  
  abline(v = data_imp$Impunity[i], lty = 3, lwd = 2, col = "black")
  title(titulo, line = 0.3, cex.main = 1.4)
  legend(x = 0.22, y = max(c(d_par1, d_ll)),
    legend = c("plogit1", "log-log"), col = c("black", "gray60"),
    lty = c(1, 2), lwd = 2, bty = "n", cex = 1)
}

plot_density(i = 63, zmin = 0.10, zmax = 0.25, titulo = "Luxembourg")
plot_density(i = 80, zmin = 0.10, zmax = 0.27, titulo = "New Zealand")
plot_density(i = 39, zmin = 0.10, zmax = 0.27, titulo = "Germany")
```

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates several key features of the `SimplexRegressionAMM` package:
  
1. **Parametric mean link functions** (plogit1, plogit2) provide flexibility by estimating the link parameter from the data;
2. **Model selection** using Scout Score, AIC, BIC and HQIC effectively identifies the best-fitting model
3. **Comprehensive diagnostics** including residual analysis, influence measures, and specification tests help validate model adequacy
4. The **selected model** (simplex_par1 with plogit1 parametric mean link function) shows good fit and appropriate residual behavior

The parametric mean link function approach offers advantages over fixed mean link functions when the optimal transformation is unknown a priori, as demonstrated by the superior performance of `simplex_par1` in this application. The `simplex_par1` model provides a slightly better fit, with associated inferences and predictions being less sensitive to atypical observations.
