Description: Provides functions for fitting and analyzing simplex regression models 
    with parametric or fixed mean link functions. The package includes implementations of the 
    simplex probability density and variance functions, several fixed and parametric 
    link functions, residual analysis and diagnostic plots, hypothesis testing procedures, 
    and influence measures such as Cook's distance and leverage (hat values). 
    It also includes the SCOUT Score (SS) criterion for model selection, 
    allowing comprehensive inference and diagnostics for simplex regression models.
