Description: Provides functions for fitting and analyzing simplex regression models 
    with either fixed or parametric mean link functions. The package implements the simplex 
    probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, 
    random number generation, and variance evaluation. It also offers several fixed and 
    parametric link functions for the mean submodel, tools for residual analysis and 
    diagnostic plotting, hypothesis testing procedures, and influence measures such as
    Cook’s distance and leverage (hat values). In addition, the package includes the 
    Scout Score (SS) criterion for model selection, enabling comprehensive inference 
    and diagnostic analysis within the simplex regression framework.
