\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"simplexregression"}}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of residual. Options:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"quantile"}: Quantile residuals (default)
  \item \code{"pearson"}: Pearson residuals
  \item \code{"pearson P"}: Standardized Pearson residuals
  \item \code{"deviance"}: Deviance residuals
  \item \code{"deviance P"}: Standardized deviance residuals
  \item \code{"standardized"}: Standardized residuals
  \item \code{"weighted"}: Weighted residuals
  \item \code{"variance"}: Variance residuals
  \item \code{"variance P"}: Standardized variance residuals
  \item \code{"biasvariance"}: Bias-variance residuals
  \item \code{"anscombe"}: Anscombe residuals
  \item \code{"williams"}: Williams residuals
  \item \code{"response"}: Response (ordinary) residuals
  \item \code{"score"}: Score residuals
  \item \code{"dualscore"}: Dual score residuals
}}

}
\value{
Numeric vector of residuals
}
\description{
Computes various types of residuals for simplex regression models
with Parametric or Fixed Mean Link Functions.
}
\details{
Different residual types are suitable for different diagnostic purposes:
\itemize{
  \item Quantile residuals follow standard normal distribution under correct
  model
  \item Pearson and deviance residuals are classical GLM residuals
  \item Standardized versions (with "P") account for leverage
  \item Standardized and Weighted residuals are useful for detecting mean model
  misspecification
  \item Variance residuals detect dispersion model misspecification
